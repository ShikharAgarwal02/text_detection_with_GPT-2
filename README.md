Overview
This project is part of my Generative AI internship with Prodigy Infotech, where I have implemented and experimented with text generation using the GPT-2 model. GPT-2, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful language model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

Objectives
The main objectives of this task are:

To set up and configure the GPT-2 model for text generation.
To generate text based on various prompts.
To customize the text generation parameters to control the output quality and creativity.

Conclusion
This project has been an exciting journey into the world of Natural Language Processing and AI. By leveraging the GPT-2 model, I have been able to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, showcasing the potential of AI in creative content generation.
